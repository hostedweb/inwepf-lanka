  <h2>INWEPF </h2>
  <blockquote>
  INWEPF is the International Network for Water and Ecosystems in Paddy Fields </blockquote>
  <p>
  The INWEPF is established to provide a forum to realize the three challenges by promoting dialogue, exchanging knowledge and experiences, creating synergy among existing forums and strengthening capacity building in agricultural water management in paddy fields with due consideration for environmental aspects.
  </p>

  <p>
  Rice is the most important crop for the countries in the Asian monsoon region, providing staple food for the people. As the population is rapidly increasing yet available freshwater resources are very limited, it is crucially important to promote sustainable water use in paddy fields with better governance including participatory irrigation management.
