<h1>Water Resources of Sri Lanka </h1>
  <blockquote>
 Over a surface area of 65,600 km2, 19.5 million people live in the country. Water bodies, a considerable portion

of which are man-made, cover about 4 percent of the land. The terrain of the island is mostly made up of coastal 

plains, with mountains rising only in the south central part.</blockquote>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>  

    <p>
Sri Lanka is a classic example of the "hydraulic civilization" which had developed in the ancient period. With the immigration of Aryans 

from Eastern India to Lanka in 543 BC, cultivation of rice developed into a grand scale in the island. As the new essentially agricultural 

Aryan civilization flourished, increasingly ambitious projects of irrigation were launched at a pace with a view to harness the monsoon 

rains. It can be safely deduced that the first great reservoirs ever in the world were built in Sri Lanka. Since the great lakes of Egypt, 

being merely natural hollows into which streams were turned do not fall into the category of man-made rainwater reservoirs as those 

of in Sri Lanka.</p>

    <div class="col-md-6"> 
 <p> <br>
The rainwater reservoirs developed in the ancient kingdom of Anuradhapura (437 BC-845 AD) & Polonnaruwa (846 AD-1302 AD), Dry 

Zone of central lowlands resulted in two season of farming while the Wet Zone remained sparsely populated and covered by thick 

forests. Today around 12,000 ancient small dams & nearly 320 ancient large dams together with thousands of man-made lakes dot 

the lowlands, with over 10,000 reservoirs in the Northern Province alone. Today Ancient Sinhalese irrigation supplemented by 

Modern Irrigation Projects continues to provide the self-sufficiency in cultivation of rice, which is the major food of the Sri Lankans.

<h2>The great royal tank builders of ancient Lanka</h2>
   </p>

<ul>
   <li> King Abhaya (474-453 BC) built the first rainwater reservoir of the island</li>

 <li>King Pandukabhaya (437-366 BC): built Abhayawewa (Basawakkulama wewa) rainwater reservoir in Anuradhapura</li>

 <li>King Vasaba (65-108 AD):  built a dozen irrigation canals & eleven tanks, the largest with a circumference of three kilometers.</li>

 <li>King Mahasena (276-303 AD): built the vast Minneriya tank & fifteen other reservoirs </li>

 <li>King Dhatusena (461-478 AD): built the vast Kala Wewa rainwater reservoir & remarkable 90km long Jaya Ganga (also called Yoda Ela) canal with a subtle gradient of 1 ft per mile </li>


 <li>King Moggalana (497-514 AD): built the Padviya this became the largest tank at the time. Today following restoration it is slightly </li>

smaller than Kalawewa & Minneriya weva.</li>

 <li>King Aggabodhi the third (623-639 AD):built the Giritale tank & several other tanks </li>

 <li>King Dappula the second (807-811 AD): built the Panduwewa (Pandu water reservoir) </li>

 <li>King Parakrambahu the great (1164-1196 AD) The royal master builder of tanks</li>
    
    </ul>

    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">    
During the reign of the great king, Lanka became to be known as the Granary of the Orient. King Parakramabahu the great built the 

restoration of 165 dams, 3910 canals, 163 major tanks and 2376 minor tanks, all in a reign of 33 years, achieving supreme 

developments in irrigation and agriculture of the Sinhalese civilization during its 2550 year long history.

Decline of the ancient Hydraulic civilization of Sri Lanka

The fall of the ancient hydraulic civilization of Sri Lanka in the 13th century was due to sudden Natural Cataclysmic change of the river 

course of the Mahaweli Ganga & was not due to foreign invasions as historians would want us to believe. The scientific evidence is 

clearly seen in the aerial photographs of the old course of the Mahaweli Ganga & its new river courses. The ancient Mahaweli with its 

ancient charities which were beside the old river like a string of pearls now lay stranded beside it. While the present river flows 

elsewhere with no charities beside it which event took place in circa 1220 AD. This sudden geological cataclysm that changed the river 

course that sustained our ancient hydraulic civilization, led to disease & famine. This resulted in the major part of the population to 

abandon these areas & move to the Wet & Intermediate Zones where the king also established himself at Dambadeniya, Kurunagala, 

Gampola, Kotte & Kandy.

<h2>Further Decline of Ancient irrigation schemes during British Colonialism (1815-1948) in Ceylon</h2>

During the early period of British rule the colonial administration was pre-occupied with military & political consolidation, & thereafter, 

with capitalist enterprise in plantation exploiting the riches of the island supplanted cultivation of rice with cash crops, first coffee & 

then Tea & Rubber. With no interest taken & no support extended to the farmers on irrigation of paddy fields, the tanks gradually fell 

into disrepair, turning much of the countryside into malarial swampland. A modern historian calls this a "regrettable but 

understandable situation, given the fact that the higher bureaucracy itself had been so deeply involved in plantation agriculture

        <h2>Rehabilitation of ancient rainwater reservoirs</h2>


The dire situation of the island resulted in a national independence movement taking root over the issues of land, irrigation & 

cultivation. Having realized the gravity of the situation, during the second half of the 19th century & first half of the 20th century, the 

British colonialists launched on a project of restoration of ancient rainwater reservoirs. Restoration of the major Kala Wewa rainwater 

reservoir with a capacity of nearly 145 million cbm was carried about during 1885 to 1887.

Following the independence from the British in 1948, the rehabilitation of major ancient irrigation works has been accelerated by the 

national leaders of the independent Ceylon.

Gal Oya Scheme

In 1952, modern Gal Oya Scheme testified to the brilliance of the ancient masterminds of irrigation engineering in Lanka: the discovery 

of remnants dated back to 1500 years of a dam site and two sluices almost exactly at the locations determined for the new reservoir 

by the engineers at the Gal Oya project. In order to preserve the excavated ruins of the dams & sluice gates, the priceless archeological 

findings, the government decided to move the new dam site to another location.

Maduru - Oya reservoir

In 1978 when modern engineers cleared the jungle to pave the way for the modern Maduru-Oya reservoir they stumbled on an 

ancient breached earth dam at the very spot where engineering experts had decided to straddle the river. This dam a little over 23 

meters high has been dated to be over 2000 years old & indicates the existence of a vast reservoir before its breach.
