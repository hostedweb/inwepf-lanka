Achieving the Goals of Food security
In Sustainable Paddy Water Ecosystems        </blockquote>
        <p>
            The INWEPF Sri Lankan committee is pleased to announce that the 12th Steering meeting and INWEPF Symposium 2015 will be held in Sri Lanka in collaboration with the Ministry of Irrigation. Availability of usable water and food security have become critical issues in the world in the face of drastic changes created by climate change. Withdrawal of water from this resources for irrigation alone has been estimated to be nearly 70%. With this heavy freshwater usage for the irrigated agriculture sector especially for paddy cultivation, there is a need to concentrate for efficiency and optimizing management especially in view of impending shortages. Conservation of water in paddy fields paying due attention to the ecological settings in the environment of irrigation systems has become imperative. In this context paddy producing countries formed the "International Network for Water and Ecosystems in Paddy Fields" to formulate a forum to face for the three challenges, " Food security and poverty alleviation, sustainable water use and partnership" highlighted at the ministerial meeting on water for food and agriculture organized by Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry of Japan and FAO on the occasion of 3rd World Water Forum held in Japan in 2003. Presently 17 countries and 8 international organizations are members of INWEPF. Objective of the symposium Since this is the only global /Asian forum of water professionals in paddy producing countries, the objective of the symposium is to create knowledge and experience sharing platform for professionals from the irrigated agriculture sector who play significant multiple roles in improving land and water productivity as well as protecting the related ecosystems.
